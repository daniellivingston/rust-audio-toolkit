# RAT: The Rust Audio Toolkit

[![CI](https://github.com/daniellivingston/rust-audio-toolkit/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/daniellivingston/realtime-audio-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

*Rust Audio Toolkit* (RAT) is a high-performance, low-latency library for advanced audio processing and analysis.

## Demo

To test out the functionality of RAT in a GUI application, run:

```sh
cargo run --example demo
```

This builds and launches a simple `egui` application, which demos most of RAT's functionality.
